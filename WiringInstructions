Proper Wiring instructions for the current build:

1. Open the Cyber G
2. Use like a thin blade like an Exacto knife around the edges of the rubber thing on the logo. Under it are a board and screws
3. Disconnect the ribbon cable from the board and remove the 5 screws then remove the large screw under
4. Remove the keyboard/guitar paddle
5. Remove the screws
6. You should be able to pull off the top completely
