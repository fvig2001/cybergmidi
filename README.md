Cyber G Midi aims to add midi to the Enya Cyber G shitty guitar. 

Currently I have added a front USB-C port on the keyboard. Tentatively, this project will add a Teensy inside the Cyber G and it will read the guitar neck and send out MIDI data for use with a VST.

Maybe down the line, I can decode the midi from the piano that is received by the device and basically have both midis with different channels using only 1 device. 
It probably won't happen since I don't quite understand the curent output of the guitar (random 4 bytes of data at the end).
